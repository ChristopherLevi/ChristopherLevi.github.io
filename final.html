			<h3>What you pay?</h3>
			<p>Nonprofit organization travel expense grants are funds provided without a fee or expectation of repayment from the provider. Sometimes the provider is actually a nonprofit organization, but travel expense grants can be offered by for-profit companies as a kind of donation. Travel expense grants normally cover the cost, or a part of the cost, of transportation, lodging and food.</p>

			<h3>Why dont you pay?</h3>
			<p>Nonprofit organization travel expense grants are often given for continuing education opportunities. These opportunities are usually available at conferences or special niche events. While finding nonprofit organization travel expense grants is a relatively easy process, the grants tend to be very competitive. There are often a limited number of travel expense grants available, compared to the number of people searching for them. Knowing where to find nonprofit organization travel expense grants is the first step. Understanding how and when to apply for them is another. </p>

			<h3>Time management</h3>
			<p>The first place to check for nonprofit travel expense funding is with the host entity. Usually an organization sponsoring an event will provide a limited number of travel grants that cover only part of the expense. For example, the host organization might waive the entrance fee, or provide hotel accommodations for some participants. In academia, it is not uncommon for students to apply to their university for a travel grant. In the private sector, corporate sponsors often can be found to cover part of the travel expenses. Although grants might be available, it is rare for any one nonprofit organization employee to get the full cost paid by a single source.</p>
